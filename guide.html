            <h3>Dr. Strange</h3>
            <p>Category: Vanguard <br>
                Type: Sheild <br>
                Dr. Strange is a powerful vanguard hero with powerful abilities that allow him to control the battlefeild. <br>
                While Strange has a shield it is best to take angles that do not expose him directly to the entire enemy team. <br>
                damaging enemies builds up energy that can be released to damage nearby enemies. however it is best to keep an eye on this ability and not overuse it as once you reach 100% you cannot be healed for a time. This ability should be charged up as much as possible and used to destroy low health enemies or to simply gain ult-charge. <br>
                Strange's ultimate ability is an area of effect stun. It is best for any hero to not hold unto ults for too long. You should be using his ultimate when you are nearly fully charged and your e is not on cooldown. Then after the enemy is stunned you will notice that their souls are visible. If you align yourself so you are next to both the enemy and their souls you can use one burst of your primary fire and a quick melee to fully charge your dispel darkness ability. This will allow you to one shot most enemies. <br>
